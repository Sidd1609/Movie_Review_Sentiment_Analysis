# Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
This is python code analyzing 1000 movie reviews using basic concepts of Natural Language processing. This model goes in stages ,first we generate tokens then generate a vocabulary and then we use classification algorithms to cluster the reviews into positive and negative. Here we use a naive bayes approach for the classification. The features are 'review' and 'sentiment'. We calculate a sentiment value for all the words and then the overall for the entire review. The model is trained using 'Bag of words model'
