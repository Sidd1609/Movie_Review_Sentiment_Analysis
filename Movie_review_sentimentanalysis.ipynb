              " 'cv003_11664.txt': b' \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \\nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \\nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\\' now infamous score . \\ndah-dum . \\nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \\nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \\nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\\' music . \\nhe\\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \\nhe doesn\\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\\'s right and going against the entire town . \\n \" it\\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe\\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\\'s performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can\\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg\\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n',\n",

\\nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\\'s acting ability . \\nalmost every time he\\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \\nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \\nhis is an interesting character . \\nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \\n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \\nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \\nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \\nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \\nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \\ngray really lucked out with this cast . \\ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \\nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \\nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \\nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \\nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \\nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \\nfortunately , this doesn\\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \\nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \\nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \\nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \\nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \\nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \\nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \\nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\\'s reality . \\nwe\\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \\nas an audience , we\\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \\nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \\n',\n",
